# Music-Calculator

A handy app for doing some common musical calculations. 

A couple of issues with it at the moment: 
 - MIDI values go over 127. This is for convenience and consistant apperence but it clearly incorrect since notes over 127 are undefined. 
 - The BPM and tuning fields will not take input - this would be handy.
