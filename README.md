# Music-Calculator

A handy app for doing some common musical calculations. 

A couple of issues with it at the moment: 
 - MIDI values go over 127. This is for convenience and consistant apperence but it clearly incorrect since notes over 127 are undefined. 
 - It would be good to be able to enter a freq and get a note with a tuning offset back. Certainly possible but will take a little thought.
